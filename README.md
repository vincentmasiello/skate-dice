## Skate Dice
######version 0.1

<br />
This is a simple skate dice app designed for the web. Read below if you want to know why. Find it hosted [here](). (this link will work when it's actually hosted)

####TODO:
 - add separate player tracking
 - show full trick title or possibilities (i.e. 360 + kickflip + backside == tre flip || backside 360 kickflip)
 - ledge/rail & manual options
 - difficulty selection for each dice individually
 - exclude certain hard tricks on easy mode (reg bigspin heelflips still possible on easy for example o_O)
 - make trick output smarter
 - only fakie, switch, regular -> add 'ollie'
	 - only  frontside/backside -> add '180' or 'ollie'
 - move down settings into sexy 'prefs' pane; show/hide
 - make everything prettier (dice graphics and such)

#### Why?
Neither I nor this project are affiliated with whichever entity owns the official 'SK8 Dice' brand of products in any way. This was written for fun. 

I liked using the official SK8 dice app on my [smart phone] to warm up before a session, practice flatground tricks, etc. When my [smart phone] was stolen I had to activate an old flip-phone from 2005. Rather than keep asking others to download it for me on their [smart phone]s, i decided to design a simple web app they could use instead.
